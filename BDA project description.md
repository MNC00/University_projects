# BDA project
One of the projects did during my Master's degree at Henley business School where I was asked to carry out two different types of analysis on two different case studies 

## Descriptive analytics
Case study: Student satisfaction is a KPI for most, if not all higher education institutes. 
There are a range of reasons why students may or may not be satisfied with their courses. 
The Turkiye Student Evaluation Datasets gives us a small insight into the complexities that drive student experience; 

## Predictive analytics
Case study: Provide data-driven recommendations to the marketing department of the German-Hellenic bank. 
The bank has supplied anonymised data (the data we will be using has been supplied by Moro et al. (2014), and can be found in the UCI website).
