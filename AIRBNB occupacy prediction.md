# Airbnb NYC Occupancy Prediction
To do this project, we were asked to split into groups of four and develop a data science project from our own idea.
As one of my colleagues is an application insider, she presented us with her problem of being able to predict the income from her advertisement in order to improve her personal finance management.
In order to solve this real problem we came up with this project using data from one of AIRBnB's public APIs
## Introduction
Airbnb is a popular platform for expanding travel possibilities and presenting a unique and personalized way of experiencing the world. The platform's listings generate data that can be analyzed for various business decisions and customer/provider behavior insights.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project consists of information regarding apartment listings in the New York City area. It includes a mix of categorical and numeric values, ranging from apartment availability and characteristics to neighborhood and host information.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to predict the future occupation rate of apartments in NYC for the following year, based on the apartment characteristics and price. A brand new variable, 'occupation_class', was created to divide the apartments into 4 groups based on their occupation rate.

## Methodology
The study adopted a comparative approach by using four different methods: OLS, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network. The methods were applied to a vast amount of data from the Airbnb listing dataset of New York City.

## Assumption
It is assumed that the population represented in the dataset is representative of reality.
